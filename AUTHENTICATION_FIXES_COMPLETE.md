# Python Quest - Authentication System Fixes: Completion Confirmation

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 2, 2025
**Project:** Python Quest - A Gamified Python Learning Platform
**Lead Development Team:** Factory AI Development Team
**Status:** Critical Authentication Fixes Implemented & Verified

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document confirms the successful resolution of critical issues reported following the initial implementation of the Phase 2 self-custody keystore authentication system. The fixes address user experience concerns regarding password visibility and a cryptographic error preventing account creation, as well as incorrect progress persistence logic.

The Python Quest platform's authentication and progress management systems are now functioning as per the intended design, ensuring a secure, user-friendly, and reliable experience.

## 2. Issues Addressed and Resolutions

The following issues have been successfully resolved:

### 2.1. Missing Password Reveal Functionality
*   **Issue:** Users could not reveal their passwords while typing in the "Create Account" or "Login with Keystore" forms.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Implemented "Show/Hide Password" functionality (Eye/EyeOff icons) on all password input fields within `src/components/LoginPage.tsx`.
    *   This enhances user experience by allowing users to verify their password input, reducing errors.

### 2.2. Account Creation Failure ("The key is not of the expected type")
*   **Issue:** Users were unable to create new accounts, encountering a cryptographic error: "Account creation failed: The key is not of the expected type."
*   **Resolution:**
    *   The root cause was identified as inconsistent browser support for the Ed25519 algorithm in the Web Crypto API.
    *   The cryptographic key generation and signing mechanism in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` has been updated to use **ECDSA P-256** (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with the P-256 curve), which has broader and more consistent browser compatibility.
    *   Keystore files now use `version: "2.0-ecdsa"` and `keyAlgorithm: "ECDSA-P256"` to reflect this change.
    *   Account creation is now robust and functions correctly across modern browsers.

### 2.3. Incorrect Progress Persistence
*   **Issue:** Learning progress was incorrectly persisting across different authentication states (e.g., guest progress remaining after logout, or being visible to a keystore user, and vice-versa). Progress was not being cleared on logout.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   The `src/contexts/ProgressContext.tsx` has been significantly updated to correctly scope progress data based on the user's authentication mode (obtained from `AuthContext`):
        *   **Guest Mode:** Progress is now stored in `sessionStorage` (key: `pythonProgress_guest`). This data is temporary and cleared when the browser session ends (e.g., browser closed).
        *   **Keystore Mode:** Progress is stored in `localStorage` using a user-specific key (e.g., `pythonProgress_user_${publicKeyHex}`). This ensures progress is persistent for the authenticated user and isolated from other users or guest sessions.
        *   **Unauthenticated Mode:** No progress is loaded or saved.
    *   The `logout` process (handled in `src/pages/Index.tsx` by calling `clearProgress()` from `ProgressContext` before `authLogout()` from `AuthContext`) now correctly clears any active progress data (guest or keystore-specific) from its respective storage.
    *   Switching between authentication modes or logging into different keystore accounts now correctly loads or initializes progress specific to that context, preventing data cross-contamination.

## 3. Current System Status

With these fixes implemented and pushed to the `factorAI` branch:

*   **Password Reveal:** Fully functional on all password fields in the login/creation forms.
*   **Account Creation:** Users can successfully create new keystore accounts without cryptographic errors. The system uses ECDSA P-256 keys.
*   **Login with Keystore:** Users can log in with keystores created using the updated ECDSA P-256 mechanism. (Note: Older Ed25519 keystores will not be compatible).
*   **Progress Persistence:**
    *   Guest progress is temporary and session-bound.
    *   Authenticated user progress is persistent and scoped to their unique keystore identity.
    *   Logging out correctly clears active progress.
*   **All Authentication Flows:** The three primary user flows (Login, Create Account, Try as Guest) and the guest-to-keystore account upgrade path are working as intended, with correct progress handling.
*   **UI Consistency:** All changes maintain the sleek, professional user interface of Python Quest.

The authentication system is now stable, secure, and aligns with the user's requirements for self-custody and data management.

## 4. Relevant Commits (Pushed to `factorAI` Branch)

The fixes detailed above were implemented in the following commits:

*   **`2684517`**: `fix: Add password reveal functionality and resolve crypto key compatibility issues`
    *   Addresses password reveal and the switch from Ed25519 to ECDSA P-256 in `AuthContext.tsx` and `LoginPage.tsx`.
*   **`9de543d`**: `fix: Implement proper progress persistence scoped by authentication mode`
    *   Addresses the incorrect progress persistence by updating `ProgressContext.tsx` and `Index.tsx`.

## 5. Next Steps

The Python Quest platform, with these authentication and progress management fixes, is now in a robust state for:

*   Thorough User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of all authentication and progress flows.
*   Consideration for merging the `factorAI` branch to `main` for production deployment.
*   Proceeding with **Phase 3: Enhanced Code Playground** development.

The Factory AI Development Team confirms that the reported issues have been diligently addressed, and the system's integrity and user experience have been restored and improved.
